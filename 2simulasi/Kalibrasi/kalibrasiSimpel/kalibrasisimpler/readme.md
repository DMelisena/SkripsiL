The name of all file is changed to avoid confusion on versions.
The name though, is unchanged on the server which are (1kalibrasisimpel.py)
1.1 still uses the l ld etc variables and different cell coverage system, prolly dont have water phantom on the surrounding area.
1.5 is the most recent version before the 2 which is counted as the right one
2 is the final version 
kalibrasisimpler differ from the kalibrasisimpel in that the water phantom on kalibrasisimpel is only the tally size. so its not 40x40x40 but only 6x6x10
but the kalibrasisimpler also uses 40x40x10 instead for simplicity but it shouldn't differ.
